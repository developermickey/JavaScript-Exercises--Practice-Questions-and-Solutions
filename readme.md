## 🛠 How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/javascript-exercises.git
   cd javascript-exercises
   ```

2. **Run Exercises**

   * Using Node.js (recommended for logic-based problems):

     ```bash
     node basic/variables.js
     ```

   * For DOM-related files, open them directly in the browser, or use CodePen/JSFiddle.

3. **Practice & Modify**

   * Each file contains problems and their solutions (usually commented).
   * Try solving them first before checking the answers.

## 🧰 Recommended Tools

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* Browser Console (for DOM & events)
